metalog - logic metaprogramming
===============================

Introduction
------------

**metalog** aims to implement an automatic logical inference system based on the unification and SLD resolution algorithms at compile-time in c++, 
therefore using solely metaprogramming and preprocessor technics. 
For easy integration and maintance, metalog is built on top of boost::mpl and complies as close as possible to its various generic concepts.
