# munify - meta unification #

## Introduction ##

**munify** aims to implement an automatic logical inference system based on the unification algorithm at compile-time in c++, 
therefore using solely metaprogramming and preprocessor technics. 
For easy integration and maintance, munify is built on top of boost::mpl and complies as close as possible to its various generic concepts.
